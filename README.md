# Overview of the analysis:
Des Monisa still needs more imformation to convince investors. They would now like to see a bike trip analysis. Information tell the ride history and when people like to ride. 

# Results:
some things we can tell by look at the data is :
* There are more male riders and subscribers that take rides*
* The bikes are used more during times when people got to work and come back from work.
* Weekends rides are more spread out between 11am and 5pm.

# Summary:
Using the information doesnt only tell us how many people will ride our bikes but also the best times to put them out and how many. Even using data like where people start rides can tell us where to place it as well.
